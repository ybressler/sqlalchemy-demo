# SQLAlchemy Demo
The following repo is a demo for how to create a manage a database using sqlalchemy.

## Before you get started
You'll need a database configured to your local machine. I'd suggest using MySQL or Postgres.
Both are free and are easy to manage. For the purpose of this demo, it does not matter
which database you choose to use.

## Getting started
_The following is written for unix machines..._
1. Launch a new (and empty) database from your local machine:
* Here's a video tutorial how to create a database on your machine: https://youtu.be/LXKTQWoQAj8
* I recommend using [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)


2. Download this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/ybressler/sqlalchemy-demo.git
```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it. Then, install the requirements:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_You're now ready to begin!_
